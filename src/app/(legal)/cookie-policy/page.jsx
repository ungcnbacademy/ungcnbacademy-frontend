          Third parties may also collect information via our Platform through
          cookies, third party plug-ins and widgets. These third parties collect
          data directly from your web browser and the processing of this data is

          We use cookies and pixel tags to track our customers&apos; usage of
          the Platform and to understand our customers&apos; preferences (such
          as country and language choices). This enables us to provide services
          to our customers and improve their online experience. We also use
          cookies and pixel tags to obtain aggregate data about Platform traffic
          and interaction, to identify trends and obtain statistics so that we
          can improve our Platform. There are generally four categories of
          cookies used on our Platform:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Strictly Necessary (Always on)</b>: Enables core functionality to
            power your language, location and shopping bag. Also supports
            security, network management and accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Personalised Experiences</b>: Allows use of behavioral data,
            using cookies and other technologies, to improve your experience and
            provide relevant content on The Label platforms and in communications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Performance & Analytics</b>: Allows use of behavioural data to
            optimise performance, review how you interact with our sites and
            apps, and improve The Label experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Personalised Advertising</b>: Allows sharing of behavioural data
            with advertising partners. This data is used to enhance and report
            on the personalised advertising experience on partner sites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          We interact with third-party analytics services on our Platform. These
          third parties share reports with us about the use of our Platform,
          including to help us better understand our Platform users&apos;
          interests and demographics. These reports do not contain information
          that directly identifies you. However, they can be used by these third
          parties for our remarketing campaigns to you if you have turned on
          certain ads personalization services. Where required by applicable
          law, we will obtain your consent to conduct this activity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can always change your preference by visiting the &apos;Cookie
          Settings&apos; at the bottom of each page of our websites.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You may also see our ads on other websites, such as our partner&apos;s
          websites, because we use third-party ad services. Through these ad
          services, we can show you ads that may be tailored to your individual
          interests. These ad services may also track your online activities
          over time and across multiple websites and apps by collecting
          information through automated means. This data collection takes place
          both on our Platform and on third-party websites and apps that
          participate in these ad services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of every third-party
          accessing your web browser (through The Label Platform or otherwise), we
          recommend installing a web browser plugin built for this purpose. You
          can also choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is
          being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this
          through your browser settings on each browser and device that you use.
          Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu
          to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies
          off, you may not have access to many features that make our Platform
          more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are also general resources for opting out of interest-based
          advertising available on the website of the Digital Advertising
          Alliance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Similarly, you can adjust your advertising preferences on your mobile
          device at the device level. For example, to adjust your advertising
          preferences in iOS, visit Settings {`\u003E`} Privacy {`\u003E`}
          Advertising {`\u003E`} Limit Ad Tracking. To adjust your advertising

        <h3>USING The Label Platform with Third-Party Products and Services</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our Platform allows you to interact with a wide variety of other
          digital products and services. For example, our Platform can integrate
          with third-party devices for activity tracking, social networks, music
          streaming services and other digital services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you choose to connect your The Label account with a third-party
          device or account, your privacy rights on third-party platforms will
          be governed by their respective policies. For example, if you choose
          to share your The Label activity on third-party social media platforms,
          if you browse our website while being authenticated on third-party
          platforms and you turned on certain ads personalization services, or
          if you ask us to link your The Label account with your membership
          accounts with The Label&apos;s Partners, the policies of those
          third-party platforms and Partners govern the data that resides there.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our Platform may provide links to other (third-party) websites and
          apps for your convenience or information. Linked sites and apps have
          their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly encourage you
          to review. To the extent any linked websites or apps are not owned or
          controlled by us, we are not responsible for their content, any use of
          the websites or apps, or the privacy practices of the websites or
          apps.

          Applicable law and our practices change over time. If we decide to

          data, we will provide you with prior notice, or where legally

          strongly encourage you to read our privacy policy and keep yourself
